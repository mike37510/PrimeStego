# PrimeStego

## Introduction

PrimeStego is an innovative application that combines the use of Amazon Prime with steganography to offer a secure and convenient solution for sharing sensitive data. With PrimeStego, you can easily hide ZIP files containing your confidential data within dynamically generated PNG images. These images can then be uploaded to Amazon Prime Photos, which offers unlimited storage for Prime members.

## How it Works

PrimeStego utilizes steganography, the art of concealing information within other non-secret data, to embed ZIP files into PNG images. The process involves generating PNG images with random shapes and text, then hiding the ZIP files within these images. The resulting images appear normal to the naked eye but contain hidden data that can be extracted using PrimeStego.
